# This function provides an easy way for tests to create a new browserchannel server using

# tests will need to customise the options, so they can just create another server directly.

  # object. This little createServer function will mirror that behaviour.

  # The server is created using connect middleware. I'll simulate other middleware in
  # the stack by adding a second handler which responds with 200, 'Other middleware' to
  # any request.

    # some defaults).

  # Calling server.listen() without a port lets the OS pick a port for us. I don't
  # know why more testing frameworks don't do this by default.

    # Obviously, we need to know the port to be able to make requests from the server.
    # The callee could check this itself using the server object, but it'll always need
    # to know it, so its easier pulling the port out here.
