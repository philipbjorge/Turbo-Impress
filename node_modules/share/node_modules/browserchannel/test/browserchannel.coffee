#
# Run them by first launching
#
#     % coffee test/runserver.coffee
#
# ... Then browsing to localhost:4321 in your browser or running:
#
#     % nodeunit test/browserchannel.coffee
#
# from the command line. You should do both kinds of testing before pushing.
#
#
# These tests are pretty simple and primitive. The reality is, google's browserchannel
# client library is pretty bloody well tested. (I'm not interested in rewriting that test suite)
#
# However, its important to do some sanity checks on the exported browserchannel bits to
# make sure closure isn't doing anything wacky. Also this acts as a nice little integration
# test for the server, _and_ its useful to make sure that all the browsers node-browserchannel
# supports are behaving themselves.
#
# Oh yeah, and these tests will be run on the nodejs version of browserchannel, which has
# a lot of silly little parts.
#
# These tests will also be useful if the browserchannel protocol ever changes.
#
# Interestingly, most of the benefits of this test suite come from a single test (really, any
# test). If any test passes, they'll all probably pass.
#
#
# ## Known Issues
#
# There's three weird issues with this test suite:
#
# - Sometimes (maybe, 1 in 10) times the test is run from nodejs, it dies in a weird inconsistant
#   state.
# - Sometimes (about 1/4 times) the tests are run, the process doesn't exit for about 5 seconds after
#   the tests have finished. Presumably, there's a setTimeout() in the client somewhere which has
#   a race condition causing it to misbehave.
# - After a test run, 4 sessions are allowed to time out by the server. (Its odd because I'm calling
#   disconnect() in tearDown).
