A [BrowserChannel](http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/closure/goog/net/browserchannel.js) server.

**tldr;** Its like socket.io, but it scales better and it has fewer bugs. It
just does long polling. It doesn't support websockets and doesn't work cross-domain.

BrowserChannel is google's version of [socket.io](http://socket.io) from when they first put
chat in gmail. Unlike socket.io, browserchannel provides much better guarantees about message
delivery and state. It has better reconnection logic and error handling. With browserchannel,
**you know whats going on**.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/josephg/node-browserchannel.png)](http://travis-ci.org/josephg/node-browserchannel)

node-browserchannel:

- Is compatible with the closure library's browserchannel implementation
- Is super thoroughly tested
- Works in IE5.5+, iOS, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and probably others.
- Works in any network environment (incl. behind buffering proxies)

# Use it

    # npm install browserchannel

Browserchannel is implemented as connect middleware. Here's an echo server:

```coffeescript
browserChannel = require('browserchannel').server
connect = require 'connect'

server = connect(
  connect.static "#{__dirname}/public"
  browserChannel (session) ->
    console.log "New session: #{session.id} from #{session.address} with cookies #{session.headers.cookie}"

    session.on 'message', (data) ->
      console.log "#{session.id} sent #{JSON.stringify data}"
      session.send data

    session.on 'close', (reason) ->
      console.log "Session #{session.id} disconnected (#{reason})"
      
    # This tells the session to stop trying to connect
    session.stop()
    
    # This just kills the session.
    session.abort()
).listen(4321)

console.log 'Echo server listening on localhost:4321'
```

The client emulates the [websocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/). Here is a simple client:

```coffeescript
{BCSocket} = require 'browserchannel'

socket = new BCSocket 'http://localhost:4321/channel'
socket.onopen = ->
  socket.send {hi:'there'}
socket.onmessage = (message) ->
  console.log 'got message', message

# later...
socket.close()
```

... Or from a website:

```html
<html><head>
<script src='/channel/bcsocket.js'></script>
<script>
socket = new BCSocket('/channel');
socket.onopen = function() {
  socket.send({hi:'there'});
  socket.close();
};
socket.onmessage = function(message) {
  // ...
};
</script>
```

You can also ask the client to automatically reconnect whenever its been disconnected. - Which is
super useful.

```coffeescript
{BCSocket} = require 'browserchannel'
socket = new BCSocket 'http://localhost:4321/channel', reconnect:true
socket.onopen = ->
  socket.send "I just connected!"
```

# Caveats

- It doesn't do RPC.
- It doesn't work in cross-origin environments. Put it behind 
  [nginx](http://nginx.net/) or [varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/) if you aren't using nodejs
  to host your whole site.
- Currently there's no websocket support. So, its higher bandwidth than socket.io running on modern
  browsers.

# How to rebuild the client

The client uses google's [closure library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/)
& [compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/). There's a couple small bugs that google
still hasn't fixed in their library (and probably never will), so I have a patch file kicking around.

Rebuilding the client library is annoying, so I keep an up to date compiled copy in `dist/`.

1. Download the closure library

```
svn checkout http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ closure-library
cd closure-library
```

2. Download the closure compiler

```
curl http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip > compiler-latest.zip
unzip compiler-latest.zip compiler.jar
```

3. Patch the library

```
patch -p0 <../node-browserchannel/closure-*.patch
```

4. Build

```
cd ../node-browserchannel
make
```
